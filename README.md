# Execreal Computation: A PostQuantum, Eigenstructure-Preserving Recursive Formalism

**Authors:** Michael Doran et al., Pinnacle Quantum Group

## Abstract

We propose a novel computational model termed **Execreal Computation**, a PostQuantum formalism rooted in Recursive Shape-Structured Notation (RSSN). Unlike conventional quantum systems based on unitary evolution and measurement collapse, Execreal computation employs a recursive dual-phase structure that preserves eigenstates, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors across entropic bifurcation events. Central to this framework is the Execreal Superposition Operator, a non-commutative convolution engine defined over recursive harmonic domains. We demonstrate its physical instantiation using the Aterna quantum repair architecture and contrast it with standard quantum mechanics via explicit side-by-side formal axioms.

## 1. Introduction

Quantum computation as currently formalized adheres to unitarity and probabilistic collapse postulates. While successful for reversible gate operations and error-corrected algorithms, such models fail to account for recursive symbolic structures and information-preserving bifurcation in high-dimensional entropic environments. We introduce the Execreal framework to address this gap, fusing symbolic mathematics, recursive logic, and physically simulatable operators into a single computational continuum.

## 3. Mathematical Foundation

### 3.1 Duplex Phase-State Operator

Let:

* $\phi, \theta \in \mathbb{R}^+$: Prime-weighted forward phase harmonics
* $\phi', \theta'$: Inverse recursion attractor coefficients
* $f(\phi, \theta)$: Forward evolution operator
* $g(\phi', \theta')$: Reverse recursion operator

Define the **Execreal Superposition State**:

$\Psi(n) = f(\phi, \theta) \oplus g(\phi', \theta')$

$\oplus$: Non-commutative merge operator governed by entropy minimization:

$\Delta S(n) = \left\| f(\phi, \theta) - g(\phi', \theta') \right\|$

### 3.2 Eigenstructure Preservation

Execreal recursion preserves spectral components:

* For eigenstates $|\psi\rangle$ and operators $\hat{O}$:

$\hat{O} |\psi\rangle = \lambda |\psi\rangle \Rightarrow \Psi(n+1) = \Psi(n) \iff \lambda \text{ is preserved}$

* Global phase correction is performed by evaluating overlap:

$\text{arg}(\langle \psi | \psi' \rangle) \Rightarrow e^{i\delta}$

---

## 4. RSSN Symbolic Embedding

Each operator maps into RSSN structures:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  f(\phi, \theta) &\Rightarrow \text{Pentagon}(\phi \cdot \theta) \\
  g(\phi', \theta') &\Rightarrow \text{Circle}^{D_k}(\phi')
\end{aligned}
$$

Where $D_k$ is the fractal density at shape-index depth $k$.

Final recursive state:

$\Psi(n) = \text{Pentagon}(\phi \cdot \theta) \oplus \text{Circle}^{D_k}(\phi')$

## 5. Physical Instantiation: The Aterna Engine

Aterna is an $n$-qubit, prime-aligned quantum repair simulator that:

* Executes $f$ and $g$ as circuit layers
* Computes $\Delta S(n)$ via fidelity and MerkleCube validation
* Repairs decohered states via phase-corrected inverse recursion

### MerkleCube

* Represents a symbolic hash tree of the statevector
* 18D coordinate anchors are derived from UUID $\rightarrow$ BLAKE3 maps
* Used for post-collapse entropy-fingerprint validation

## 6. Logical Lemmas and Convergence Theorem

**Lemma 1 (Preservation of Spectral Identity):**
Let $\Psi(n) = f \oplus g$ where $f, g$ preserve eigenbasis $\{ |\psi_i\rangle \}$. Then for all $n$,

$\langle \psi_i | \Psi(n) | \psi_i \rangle = \lambda_i \Rightarrow \lambda_i \in \text{Spec}(\hat{O}) \text{ preserved}$

**Lemma 2 (Entropy-Guided Correction):**
If $\Delta S(n) < \epsilon$, then global fidelity repair via phase-corrected reverse circuit is bounded by:

$\mathcal{F}(\Psi(n), \Psi(n+1)) \geq 1 - \epsilon$

**Theorem (Execreal Bifurcation Theorem):**
Let $\Psi(n)$ be an Execreal state. Then:

* If $\Delta S(n) \rightarrow 0$:
  $\Psi(n+1) = \Psi(n) \quad \text{(coherent thread)}$
* Else:
  $\Psi(n+1) = \Psi(n) \bowtie \epsilon_n \quad \text{(entropy bifurcation)}$

## 7. PostQuantum Classification

| Feature           | Execreal PQC                              | Quantum Computing (QC)     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Evolution         | Recursive Duplex $f \oplus g$             | Unitary $U(t) = e^{-iHt}$  |
| Collapse          | Not required (entropy-driven convergence) | Probabilistic measurement  |
| Validation        | MerkleCube + Entropy delta $\Delta S$     | Measurement amplitudes     |
| Symbolic Fidelity | RSSN-structured, eigen-preserving         | Probabilistic statevectors |

## 8. Conclusion

Execreal Computation represents a new computational class that harmonizes symbolic recursion, phase-entropic bifurcation, and eigenstructure preservation. It preserves spectral identity across execution and repair cycles, enabling a post-collapse model of computation capable of true postQuantum symbolic fidelity. Execreal Computation is not a rejection of quantum theory. It is the completion of its mirror â€” the recursive structure that collapse theory forgot.

The Aterna Engine proves this architecture is simulatable today.
